    <h2>Basketball</h2>
    <p>
      The reason why I love basketball is because of the adrenaline rush and the
      thrill. The skill in playing basketball really amazes me while the balls
      go into the nets making that "swish" sound. My favourite NBA team are the
      Los Angeles Lakers

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      The reason why video games are also my favourite is because they are a
      perfect distraction from reality. It is a great source for entertainment
      and it also boots your mood and improves happiness. My favourite video
      games are Rainbow Six Siege and Fortnite

    <h2>Working out</h2>
    <p>
      Working out has to be my favourite thing to do out of all the other thing
      listed due to how it makes you feel better about yourself, you look
      better, and all the stress and tension you have built up goes away. I love
      working out.
